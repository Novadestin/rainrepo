# RainRepo
Hello everyone and welcome to this rainmeter information repository and archive.

Much of the information here will be included in [the wiki](https://github.com/Novadestin/rainrepo/wiki/%23-RainRepo-wiki:-Main-Index.), so be sure to check that out! 

And, obviously, as things are still in the process of being set up here, please be patient :)
